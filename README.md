A form using ReactJS/Redux

A simple form that takes an uploaded image or image through url and provides a preview of the image. The image is submitted as a base64 string to the form. The base64 string is displayed as an alert.

## Certain specifications.
- The url must link to an image. ( jpg/jpeg/png/gif )
- Press clear values to reselect. Remember, Image can be provided either through url or upload, not both!
- The preview is not always linked to the image selected. Clear preview to remove image.
- The form resets on submission
